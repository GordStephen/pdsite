% Running pdsite

`pdsite` uses the contents of the working directory to generate HTML files. The types of files it takes as input, the location of the output HTML, the HTML theme used, and other site-wide variables are defined via a configuration file (`.pdsite.yml`) in the current directory.

### Setting up .pdsite.yml

`pdsite` will not run in a directory unless a valid configuration file is present. To quickly create a valid file, use the `init` command:

```
$ pdsite init
```

This will create a default `.pdsite.yml` YAML file in your current directory. You can then customize it as desired. Any data defined in the config file is available to the template engine during the build process, so you can use this file to define site-wide variables. For example, the config file used to generate this site looked like:

```yaml
# pdsite configuration

theme: default
inputextension: .md
outputfolder: .html

# Site-wide template variables

bootswatch: lumen 
sitename: "pdsite"
pagetitle-suffix: "Pandoc-backed static site generator"
footer: '<a class="navbar-link" href="https://github.com/GordStephen/pdsite">GitHub Repo</a> | <a class="navbar-link" href="https://github.com/GordStephen/pdsite/issues">Report an Issue</a>'
```

### Building your site

Once a config file is defined, `pdsite` can convert the current directory into a linked website according to its folder and file structure. For example, this site was generated by the following file structure:

```
├── index.md
├── installing.md
├── running.md
└── themes
    ├── choosing-themes.md
    └── creating-themes.md
```

Converting arbitrarily-deep nested files to HTML is supported, although the built-in themes only support generating navigation menus for up to two levels of folders (e.g. `/category/subcategory/page`). A [custom theme](/themes/creating-themes) could support automatically linking to deeper files.

To generate the HTML website, just run the `build` command:

```sh
$ pdsite build
Creating new build folder... done.
Building site... done.
```
We can check the results in the specified output folder:

```sh
$ tree .html
.html
├── index.html
├── installing
│   └── index.html
├── running
│   └── index.html
├── styles.css
└── themes
    ├── choosing-themes
    │   └── index.html
    └── creating-themes
        └── index.html
```

Alternatively, you can use the `serve` command, which first builds the site and then launches a server so you can see the results in a browser.

```sh
$ pdsite serve
Clearing old build folder... done.
Building site... done.
fix_ug: uid=1000 euid=1000 / gid=1000 egid=1000 / gids: 1000 10 95 
http server started
  ipv6  : yes
  ssl   : no
  node  : localhost.localdomain
  ipaddr: ::
  port  : 8000
  export: /the/current/path/.html
  user  : theuser 
  group : thegroup 
```

Visiting `localhost:8000` in your browser will display the site output. Auto-regeneration of the site when an input file changes is not yet supported, so you'll need to stop the server and re-run the command to see any modifications.
